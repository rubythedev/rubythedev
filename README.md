# Hi, I'm Ruby!

## Software Engineer | Data Scientist | Business Intelligence Analyst | Inspiring Leader

I am a **Colby College graduate** with a multidisciplinary background in **data analytics, full-stack software engineering, AI development, and custom digital product creation**. I specialize in turning complex ideas into **clean, intuitive, high-performing systems** that blend data, design, and cutting-edge technology.

My early work includes implementing **machine learning algorithms** in **Python** (email classification, facial recognition), creating visual art with Turtle graphics, and analyzing large datasets using **SQL, Python, SPSS, and Google Sheets**. I also built **interactive Tableau dashboards** to visualize insights, track performance, and enhance decision-making.

Over time, I expanded into **full-stack engineering**, building web applications with **React, Next.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS**, and architecting secure databases with **PostgreSQL and Supabase**. I create full end-to-end systems, complete with **authentication flows, API development, OpenAI integrations**, and modern UI/UX principles.

### 🌱 What’s Next:
I’m currently expanding both sides of my career: RubyAliFitness and RubytheDev. On the fitness side, I’m building a modern, AI-powered wellness ecosystem that merges software engineering, data analytics, and user-centered design to create transformative mind–body–spirit experiences. This includes launching new web applications, digital programs, personalized workout generators, and interactive dashboards that empower users to track, measure, and optimize their transformations.

On the development side, I’m continuing to engineer advanced software projects for clients—websites, AI-powered applications, custom automation systems, dashboards, and digital tools that help their businesses scale in more intelligent and efficient ways. I’m particularly focused on developing applications that leverage OpenAI, predictive analytics, API ecosystems, and complex database architectures to unlock new levels of capability for brands and entrepreneurs.

Looking forward, I plan to keep merging creativity with technology—building more innovative products, expanding my client portfolio, and pushing deeper into AI engineering, automation, and full-stack development. My mission is to help businesses and individuals grow through smart, beautiful, data-driven software that opens doors to entirely new possibilities.
